## Common <hr>

player and the referee of the Q game.

The files for the data representations for `milestone-2`:

The files for the data representation for `milestone-3`:
- [GameState.java](Common/src/main/java/Referee/GameState.java)
- [PlayerOrder.java](Common/src/main/java/Referee/PlayerOrder.java)

- Actions:
  - [PassAction.java](Common/src/main/java/Action/PassAction.java)
  - [PlaceAction.java](Common/src/main/java/Action/PlaceAction.java)
