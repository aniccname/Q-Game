SUBJECT: Important Questions

We would like to pose the following important questions:
1. What does it mean for a player to be eliminated by the referee?

Does it mean getting banned or kicked? Could it mean simply becoming a spectator
of the game?

2. Can a second Q be completed that overlaps with an existing Q?
3. Are tiles replaced at the end of a players turn or throughout its turn?

The game ends when a player has placed all tiles in its possession. If the referee
hands the player tiles after the player places all the tile it wants to, there is
a moment wherethe player placed all tiles in its possession and the game should
end. If the player receives tiles as they are placed, the game should not end.
