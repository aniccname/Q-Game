# Q Game
A Quirkle "clone" developed mostly in the Fall 2023 Software Development course.

The "Q" folder was all done as part of the class, and 3 other individuals contributed to the codebase. I contributed along with my partner from November to the end of the class in December. 

The "Q-web-client-folder" is a personal extension to be able to provide a way for human players to play the game. It is all written by me with no partner.
